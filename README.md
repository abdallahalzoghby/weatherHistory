# weatherHistory
In this project, we analyze historical weather data from weatherHistory.csv to:  Classify precipitation type (rain vs. snow) using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Lasso, and Elastic Net.  Predict the apparent temperature (Â°C) using regression models like Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.
